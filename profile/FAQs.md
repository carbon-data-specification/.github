  ## How can I get involved?
  First things first, educate yourself on the [scope](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Steering_Committee/blob/main/Scope.md) of the project and the processes for how [Customer Data working group](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/), [Power Systems Data working group](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data), and the [strategy committee](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KCMBszIxGxq2IXHwzyk5dL61bqP60a7WpNijD7BNEBI/edit#slide=id.p1) operates. Depending on your desired level of engagement, your involvement could look like the following:
  1. **I'd like visibility on the progress.** Great, learn more [here](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Steering_Committee) about how to join the TSC communication channels and meetings, as well as review the TSC meeting notes and materials for high level readouts and updates.
  2. **I'd like to provide light feedback on the specifications.** For this, you should review the respective working groups GitHub repos and follow the contribution guidelines defined for each working group ( CONTRIBUTING.md ).
  3. **I'd like to actively participate and contribute.** This requires more commitment, but also helps you drive more value. The steps here would be to join the respective working group’s communication channels and meetings listed in each working group’s GitHub repository, participating in the discussions and providing your feedback and insight.
