![Carbon Data Specifications Consortium](https://artwork.lfenergy.org/projects/cdsc/horizontal/color/cdsc-horizontal-color.svg)

The Carbon Data Specification is a data dictionary for raw data and a standard for data requirements that enable energy data access for measuring, quantifying, and tracking carbon emissions from energy production and consumption. These standards and requirements should boost confidence in data sources, increase data utilization, promote scalability, and enable data aggregation for centralized platforms, which shall support and inform grid decarbonization pathways and decision-making.

The Working Groups of the Project consist of:

- [Customer Data Working Group](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data); and
- [Power Systems Data Working Group](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data)

The Project is overseen by the [CDSC Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Steering_Committee), which approves by up or down vote the final specifications, along with:

- Ensures alignment between working groups
- Determines the allocation of resources (financial requests from LF Energy) will require a Strategic Member sponsoring the request which goes to the LF Energy Governing Board 
- Participation in the CDSC TSC is open all, but voting is restricted to LF Energy General and Strategic members only.

The Project additionally has a [Strategy Committee](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-strategy-committee) which is focused on:

- care and evolution of the specification; 
- enabling adoption; and 
- determining and recommending changes to the scope of the Project.
