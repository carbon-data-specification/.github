![Carbon Data Specifications Consortium](https://artwork.lfenergy.org/projects/cdsc/horizontal/color/cdsc-horizontal-color.svg)

The Carbon Data Specification is a data dictionary for raw data and a standard for data requirements that enable energy data access for measuring, quantifying, and tracking carbon emissions from energy production and consumption. These standards and requirements should boost confidence in data sources, increase data utilization, promote scalability, and enable data aggregation for centralized platforms, which shall support and inform grid decarbonization pathways and decision-making.

The Working Groups of the Project are specified by the category of data and standards that they will include, namely:

- [Customer Data Working Group](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/); and
- [Power Systems Data Working Group](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/)

For details on the respective scopes and how to get involved in each working group, please visit the pages linked above. There you will find how to subscibe to the respective mailing list, calendar, and slack channel. You can join the [cdsc-general](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-general) mailing list for high level updates.

Participation in the project is open to all, including: reviewing public information on the repository, website, or mailing list; engaging on the mailing list or Slack channel; attending meetings; commenting on issues or pull requests; and forking the repositories to play around with code or documentation (we're open source!). However, in order to contribute comments, suggestions, or other content that will be included in our specifications, or open pull requests with proposed changes to our repository or specifications, your company must join as an LFESS member (it's free!). You can complete the membership application at [joinnow.lfess.org](https://joinnow.lfess.org).

The CDSC community meets every four weeks on Wednesdays at 8:00 am US Pacific Time/11:00am US Eastern Time/5:00pm Central European Time to align on the work happening across the working groups and assess the specification development process. Meeting minutes are saved to a shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/corp/drive/folders/1FZNXAgUY_MEez_d89FX9j_4xK04YAFnV). Register for the meeting [here](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/99111842486). 

You can see the full calendar of community activities [here](https://calendar.carbondataspec.org) (note the timezone in the bottom left corner of the page).

The Project is overseen by the LF Energy Standards and Specifications (LFESS) Steering Committee, which approves by up or down vote the final specifications as well as ensuring the project has the needed resources to be successful.
