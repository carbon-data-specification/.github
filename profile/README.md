![Carbon Data Specifications Consortium](https://artwork.lfenergy.org/projects/cdsc/horizontal/color/cdsc-horizontal-color.svg)

The Carbon Data Specification is a data dictionary for raw data and a standard for data requirements that enable energy data access for measuring, quantifying, and tracking carbon emissions from energy production and consumption. These standards and requirements should boost confidence in data sources, increase data utilization, promote scalability, and enable data aggregation for centralized platforms, which shall support and inform grid decarbonization pathways and decision-making.

The Working Groups of the Project consist of:

- [Customer Data Working Group](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data); and
- [Power Systems Data Working Group](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data)

The CDSC community meets every four weeks on Wednesdays at 8:00 am US Pacific Time/11:00am US Eastern Time/5:00pm Central European Time to align on the work happening in the working groups and assess the specification development process. Register for the meeting [here](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/99111842486)

The Project is overseen by the LF Energy Standards and Specifications Steering Committee, which approves by up or down vote the final specifications as well as ensuring the project has the needed resources to be successful.
